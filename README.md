## Project Description
***

##### Overview:
This is the frontend for my final project with Flatiron School. I was tasked to build an application that uses a Ruby on Rails Backend, and a React/Redux frontend. Since I have experience in game and app development, I thought it would be cool to make a browser based video game with the skills that I learned in Flatiron.
[Backend](https://github.com/RobertTTaylor9517/Battle-Royale-Plus-backend)

##### Challenges:
My main challenge was splitting the game logic between the frontend and the backend. I tried to keep as little logic on the frontend as possible so it would mostly handle the graphics.


## Getting Started

2. Open it in a terminal or your favorite IDE
3. In the terminal run `npm install && npm start` This will install all neccessary npm packages that are needed for the app to run
4. You can use the fetch.js file to change the backend path
